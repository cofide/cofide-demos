# Cofide Demos

This repository has example applications that are used to demonstrate Cofide's open source tools, including `cofidectl`. 

The examples include `ping-pong` that can be deployed in a single Cofide trust zone, or federated across trust zones with multiple clusters.

## Deploy a single trust zone Cofide instance

See the [`cofidectl` docs](https://www.github.com/cofide/cofidectl/README.md#quickstart)

### Deploy an additional Cofide trust zone instance and federate the workloads
 
See the [`cofidectl` docs](https://www.github.com/cofide/cofidectl/docs/multi-tz-federation.md)
